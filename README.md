# Arduino Controllers 

## This repo contains two projects. 
* One allows for an Arduino to communicate to a computer via the serial port and Python. 
* The other allows for a computer to communicate to the Arduino, through the same means as above. 

## Both of these projects serve as a useful entry point into serial communication. 
* These scripts will be used by the Osprey Miners of UNF, but they may be used by anyone. 
* Feel free to modify these scripts, and to use them in your own projects.
